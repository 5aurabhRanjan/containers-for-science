In that case, the above example of exposing the port is in principle the right way to go, too. However, as this is a common usecase, there are a number of prepared Dockerfiles to install the notebook inside the container available at https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks, so tat one can start the Dockerfile with `FROM jupyter/...`, (instead of `FROM ubuntu/...`) and in this way build on the Dockerfiles that the Jupyter team provides already."
