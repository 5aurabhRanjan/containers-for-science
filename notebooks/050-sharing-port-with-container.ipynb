    "A common application of exposing ports is to install computational or data analysis software inside the container, and to control it from a jupyter notebook running inside the container, but to use a webbrowser from the host system to interact with the notebook. In that case, the above example of exposing the port is in principle the right way to go, too. However, as this is a common usecase, there are a number of prepared Dockerfiles to install the notebook inside the container available at https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks, so tat one can start the Dockerfile with `FROM jupyter/...`, (instead of `FROM ubuntu/...`) and in this way build on the Dockerfiles that the Jupyter team provides already."
